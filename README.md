1 - Fake and real news dataset
  Detection of Online Fake News Using Support Vector Classifier , Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression Classifier models .
 
 
 
2 - Digit Recognizer

  MNIST	dataset which is small	images	of	digits .	Each	image	is	labeled	with the	digit	it	represents numbers from 0 to 9 . using SVM ,	Firstly to explore , greyscale 
 visualization and preprocessing on 8400 samples and 33600 test samples as the data is complicated to proces and then using 

classification algorithms such as liner and ploy kernel SVM algorithm .  we  set up the Pipeline with StandardScaler and SVC(linear and poly kernal) as a transformer and estimator 
respectively and by usinf the default gamma C = 1 .
